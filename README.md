# Final-Assignment
My Last Project


I am using this as an informational page about my music blog "Blend & Snap". I wanted to create something that was unique to me and something that showcased my work. So first you see the Logo I made on photoshop at the top, then we have a description of "Blend & Snap", our current library of mixes, our IWD 2019 SoundCloud playlist, our Spotify playlist, and beneath that is the Spotify API call that features Beyonce's albums who is our "artist of the month", below that is a button cause I thought it was funny. Then there is the email feature at the bottom where you can reach my email.

Hope this looks ok! 




As of right now, I see no issues, however there were a TON at first. I had to go through a lot of steps and I had my friend come over and he helped me to get the access token because that part was the toughest. That was hardest part for sure, but its working on my end so should work for others! Please let me know if theres anything else you would like to see.
